// Instruction Design:
//
// First 8 bits are the instruction (Opcode)
// Next four bits are the mode (Register, Value, Memory)
// The rest of the bits are the arguments
// | 0000_0000 | 0000 | 0000_0000_0000_0000_0000 | -> 32 bits
// |  Opcode   | Mode |         Arguments        |
//
// We get the opcode, mode and arguemnts through bit masking
// Opcode: 0xFF000000
// Mode: 0x00F00000
// Arguments: 0x000FFFFF
//
// It's then up to the instruction to parse the arguments
// and do what it needs to do
